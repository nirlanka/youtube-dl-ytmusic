# youtube-dl-ytmusic - wrapper for data hording

Warning: This is not a professional tool, and even actually redundant. 

This is created and maintained for educational purposes. I'll be iteratively updating and making this usable as I experiment command line tools and Python.

Steps:
1. Install `pipenv`
2. Run `pipenv install xerox` for clipboard access
3. Run `pipenv install yt-dlp` better and more up-to-date fork of youtube-dl
4. Run `pipenv shell` to enter pipenv shell
5. Run `python code.py`
